Software Project Management Learning Journal

Welcome to my Software Project Management Learning Journal! This repository is a living documentation of my journey through the Software Project Management course, capturing my evolving insights, reflections, and practical applications in the realm of project management for software development. Each week, I share detailed reflections on the course content, summarizing key concepts such as effort estimation techniques, risk management strategies, and software development life cycle models. Dive into case study and project work reflections to explore how theoretical knowledge translates into real-world scenarios. Additionally, you'll find a curated collection of further research and readings, offering an extended exploration of software project management beyond the course material.
